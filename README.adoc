= COMP3071: Introduction to Programming Languages

== September 1

=== Introduce yourself

Welcome! Let's get to know each other with an icebreaker. Answer these questions:

* What is your name?
* Why is Computer Science your major?
* Tell us something nobody else in the room knows about you.

=== About this course
This course introduces programming languages (hence the name) beyond the
familiar structured imperative object-oriented and procedural https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm[programming paradigms].

We'll have a midterm, labs and assignments, but for the final project,
we'll implement a compiler or interpreter for a programming language.

We'll focus on a few languages in depth, and cover other languages briefly.
Please download SWI-Prolog, Haskell Platform and SBCL (links in table).

== September 3

=== Install language implementations

Download SWI-Prolog, Haskell Platform and SBCL (links in table above), if you haven't already done so.

=== Install Git and frontends

Windows:: https://git-scm.com/download/win[Install Git for Windows]
+
https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/releases/latest[Install Git Extensions]
+
NOTE: Select KDiff, and *choose OpenSSH* (not PuTTY); otherwise,
stick to the default settings.
+

image:http://lawrancej.github.io/starterupper/images/openssh.png[Choose OpenSSH]

Mac OS X:: http://rowanj.github.io/gitx/[Install GitX-dev], then https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/[Install XCode developer tools] which ships with git (recommended) or http://git-scm.com/download/mac[install git from here].

Linux:: http://git-scm.com/download/linux[Install git] using your package manager.
+
NOTE: Don't forget to use +sudo+ with your package manager.

=== Run starterupper

Starterupper sets up git and project hosting for this class;
it is safe to run even if you already have git and SSH keys set up on your machine.

Open Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Linux, Mac OS X) and paste in the command below.
Press `Shift-Insert` to paste in Git Bash.
